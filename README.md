# Cifar-10-
Cifar-10 object recognition challenge with simple CNN (89% accuracy after 100 epochs).
Techniques that helped increase accuracy (77%->89%):-
  1. Adding dropout layers
  2. Increasing the dropout value as we approach the final layer
  3. Adding batch-normalisation
  4. Training for a large number of epochs( Was initially training for 50 epochs)
  5. Using data augmentation
